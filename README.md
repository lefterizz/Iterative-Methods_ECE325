# ECE 325 – Iterative Methods

This repository contains the project work completed for the course **ECE 325 – Iterative Methods**.  
The projects focus on the design, implementation, and analysis of iterative algorithms across different problem domains.

The repository is structured so that each project is contained in its own subdirectory, along with a dedicated README describing the problem, algorithmic approach, correctness, and complexity analysis.

## Course Overview

The course studies algorithmic techniques for solving computational problems using iterative methods.  
Emphasis is placed on:

- Precise problem formulation  
- Clear algorithm description  
- Correctness arguments  
- Efficiency analysis using asymptotic notation  

Problems include search, decision, and optimization, solved using multiple algorithm design paradigms.
